# E-commerce Web Application
This web application is a dynamic web application for e-commerce. All data and images are came from MySQL database. Owner of the web application will update this website with MySQL and Admin View.
This application has not been finished yet. I am currently developing this application. You can download the current version.  

##Technologies
PHP 7, HTML-5, CSS3, Bootstrap, jQuery and Ajax.
Parallax Effect with Bootstrap.

Database: MySQL

## How to install
This is a server and client application, server side is developed with PHP 7. You should use a web server for this application. I am using Xampp for this project.
* Firstly, you should install Xampp with Apache server and MySQL (hint: MySQL uses 80 port, if you use Skype, Xampp can not work properly, you should change the port of Xampp or Skype)
* You should clone the project from this github page and put under htdocs folder. (htdocs folder in your Xampp folder).
* There is a init.php file in the project (under system folder), please update the file with your MySQL username and password.
* You should create a database and tables with MySql (I added my mysql dump, you can use the dump, under database_dump folder).
* Then, run Xampp.
* Finally, open a browser and go to the url, (http://localhost/ecommerce/index.php)
